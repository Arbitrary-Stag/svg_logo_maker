This is the eighth challenge of the UC Berkeley Web Development bootcamp in which we were challenged to create an SVG logo generator using node, inquirer, and jest.

## Installation 
To use this app you must have node installed as well as the packages "Inquirer" and "Jest." For this assignment I specifically used the 8.2.4 version of Inquirer. 

## Usage
To launch the app, you need to navigate to the folder containing the code and in your terminal type "node index.js"
You will then be asked a series of questions about the logo you are designing. Once you have successfully answered all the questions you will receive a message telling you that your SVG file was successfully created, or an error message if one happend to occur. The program is written to post the svg files in a folder called "examples." If you wish to have the file written elsewhere you must go into the index.js file and adjust the file location you wish for the file to be written to.
